# aes-cbc-pkcs5padding

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm that is considered to be highly secure. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a block cipher mode that is commonly used with AES. It involves chaining each block of plaintext with the previous ciphertext block before encryption. PKCS5Padding is a padding scheme used to ensure that the plaintext being encrypted is of a specific length.

When used together, AES, CBC, and PKCS5Padding provide strong encryption for sensitive data. The AES algorithm provides the bulk of the encryption, while CBC mode ensures that each block of plaintext is encrypted differently. PKCS5Padding ensures that the plaintext is of a specific length, which adds an extra layer of security. Overall, AES CBC PKCS5Padding is a reliable and secure encryption method for protecting sensitive data.
